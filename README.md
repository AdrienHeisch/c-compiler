A C compiler following the C23 standard, for educational purposes.

The end goal is to target bytecode and make a VM to run it, probably in Rust.
See [this repo](https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/lang) for my first try at this. I wanted to learn Haskell and follow the standard more closely this time.

The C source files in the repository are mostly random LLM generated code for testing.
